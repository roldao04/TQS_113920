## 1.1 Simple Stack contract
### h)
Coverage values extremely similar.
### j)
While high coverage indicates well-tested code, it does not guarantee correctness or robustness.
Additional tests, such as stress tests, concurrency tests, and boundary tests, are needed for reliability.Additional tests, such as stress tests, concurrency tests, and boundary tests, are needed for reliability.

## 1.2 EuroMillions
### c)
The class with the less coverage is 'BoundedSetOfNaturals' with a coverage of arround 54%.
Not all branches are being covered in the 'BoundedSetOfNaturals' but also in the other classes of the problem.
### d)
Yes it is necessary, to better the coverage of the tests of the class. The tests added incorporate more methoeds that were not tested before.
With the tests added the coverage jumped to 86%.
### e)
Like i said before it changed from 54% to 86%.
### f) and g)
After adding the 90% minimum check i added more test for specif branches and for classes that didnt have test associated with them.

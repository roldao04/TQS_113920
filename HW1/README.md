# HomeWork 1 - Mid-term Assignment
## Meal Booking Web Application
### Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application for managing meal reservations at the Moliceiro University campus. The application allows students to view available meal options for different restaurants, book reservations, and check reservation details. Additionally, it integrates weather forecasts to help students decide where to dine based on weather conditions.

### Features
- View Meal Plans: Students can browse the meal plans for different restaurants on campus.
- Weather Forecast Integration: Display the weather forecast for each restaurant's available meal days.
- Reservation System: Users can book meal reservations in advance.
- Reservation Details: Users can check and cancel their reservations.
- Check-in Page for Staff: Restaurant staff can verify and mark reservations as used.
- REST API: Provides endpoints for interacting with the backend programmatically.
- Caching for Weather Data: Weather data is cached to optimize performance and reduce API calls.

### Technologies Used
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- Frontend: Vite/React
- Database: MySQL
- Weather API: Integration with Visual Crossing Weather API
- Caching: Redis for weather data
- Logging: SLF4J with Logback
- Testing Frameworks:
    - Unit Tests: JUnit
    - API Testing: REST Assured / Spring Boot MockMvc
    - Functional Testing: Selenium WebDriver (BDD tests)
    - Performance Testing: JMeter / Gatling
- Code Quality & CI/CD:
    - Code Analysis: SonarQube / Codacy
    - Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
